**Who Am I?**
</div>

<div align="justify">

I’m currently studying programming and taking my first steps into the world of development. Even though technology has always caught my attention, it’s only recently that I decided to dive in and start learning how things actually work behind the scenes.
Right now, I’m focused on building a solid foundation — exploring different areas, understanding the basics, and figuring out which path I want to follow. Web Development has been especially appealing to me, mainly because it allows me to combine logic, creativity, and visual thinking.
I’m just getting started, but I’m motivated, curious, and excited to grow day by day as I continue discovering what I can create through code.
